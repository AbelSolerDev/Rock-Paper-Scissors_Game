## 🕸️ Project Description

A web application that allows its users to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, choosing between the different options and keeping a history of the latest results.

• To start the application, access the file piedraPapelTijera.html.


## 🚀 Technologies

The game engine has been developed using JavaScript. The professor provided the necessary HTML and CSS, and the requirement of this practical exercise was that we could not modify the files supplied, having to program and adapt the JavaScript file to what was required.

## ✨ Goals
